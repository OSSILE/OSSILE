:HELP     NAME='SITEDET/'.
Site Detail - Help
:XH3.Site Detail
:P.
This panel allows the entering of the information required to make a
connection to a Remote FTP Server. The password entered will be
encrypted before being stored in the database. If the remote path
does not exist the default path will be used. The remote address can
be in either dotted decimal '192.168.100.111' or english 'Helios' the
address must be available for translation in either the local hosts
or by the use of a DNS server. When entering the retry values, remember
that the delay will be used as both a timer for the connection attempt
and as a delay between attempts.  The standard timeout for a connect()
is 75 seconds, if the delay is set to more than this number the
connect() will still return after 75 secs but the delay between
attempts will be the number of seconds entered.
The retry value is the number of retries to ba taken, therefore if it
is set to 1, two attempts to connect will be made.
QSYS.LIB will take a long time to load on the local system due to the
high number of objects and the processing required to extract the
information about each object, it is therefore advisable not to use
/QSYS.LIB as the starting point for a system connection.

Connection Delay - Help
:XH3.Connection Delay
:P.
The number of seconds the connect() function will wait for a response
from the remote system, also the length of time in seconds the process
will wait between each rety. The connect() function normally returns
after 75 seconds of processing time if a response has not been received
from the remote system. Therefore setting this number higher than 75
will have no effect on the connect() function. This value is also used
to determine the delay between the connect() requests, if you enter a
number higher than 75, the program will continue to delay for the
number of seconds entered.

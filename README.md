# OSSILE

Welcome to the OSSILE project. This project is to serve three purposes:
  1. This project is to provide, via the open source community, a wide set of utilities for IBM i. They will get built into the OSSILE library.
  2. This project is to provide working examples of various things in ILE languages (RPG, C, C++)
  3. This project is to provide working examples of SQL (while not technically ILE, the examples are included here due to strong affinity and usefulness)

  - sha256, originally sourced from https://github.com/miguel-r-s/SHA-256
    a re-implementation of SHA256 in C.
    Documentation:
      - [README](main/sha256/readme.md)

  - ArrayList, originally sourced from [RPG Next Gen](http://rpgnextgen.com).
    An ArrayList is a one-dimensional array. It is also a dynamic array which
    means that the size is not set at compile time but at runtime and it can
    grow if required.

    Documentation:
      - [README](main/arraylist/README.md)
      - [API documentation](http://iledocs.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php?program=/QSYS.LIB/SCHMIDTM.LIB/QRPGLESRC.FILE/ARRAYLIST.MBR) at [ILEDocs at Sourceforge.net](http://iledocs.sourceforge.net)

  - SU, originally sourced from [bitbucket.org/cmasseVolubis/volubis](https://bitbucket.org/cmasseVolubis/volubis).
    Like Under Linux, become QSECOFR as needed

    Documentation:
      - [README](main/su/readme.md)

  - Linked List, originally sourced from [RPG Next Gen](http://rpgnextgen.com).
    An array allocates memory for all its elements lumped together as one block 
    of memory. In contrast, a linked list allocates space for each element 
    separately in its own block of memory called a linked list element or node. 
    The list gets is overall structure by using pointers to connect all its 
    nodes together like the links in a chain.
    
    The linked list utilities service program shows how to get data via a list
    instead of using a userspace.
    
    Documentation:
      - [README](main/linkedlist/README.md)
      - [API documentation](http://iledocs.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php?program=/QSYS.LIB/FIST1.LIB/QRPGLESRC.FILE/LLIST.MBR)
      - [API documentation](http://iledocs.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php?program=/QSYS.LIB/FIST1.LIB/QRPGLESRC.FILE/LUTIL.MBR)

  - Update User-Defined Attribute
    Tags a QSYS object with a value. The value is stored in the user-defined
    attribute of the object.
    
    Documentation:
      - [README](main/updusrattr/README.md)

  - Message, originally sourced from [RPGUnit](http://rpgunit.sourceforge.net).
    This service program provides wrappers for the OS message API QMHRCVPM, QMHRSNEM
    and QMHSNDPM. It eases the handling of program and escape messages.

# Installing OSSILE on your IBM i
#### Method 1: download the .zip file and compile
1. Download https://github.com/OSSILE/OSSILE/archive/master.zip and place it in IFS
2. From a PASE-capable shell (ssh client, QP2term, etc), run:
  * ``jar xvf OSSILE-master.zip``
  * ``cd OSSILE-master/main && chmod +x ./setup && ./setup``

    To exclude an item from building, remove it from buildlist.txt or comment it out with a preceding '#'

#### Method 2: Download *SAVF
1. Create a save file object on IBM i.
2. Download https://github.com/OSSILE/OSSILE/blob/master/ossile.savfsrc and upload it to the IBM i, replacing the contents of the save file you've created
2. Use the RSTLIB command to restore the OSSILE library from the save file. For example:
  * ``RSTLIB SAVLIB(OSSILE) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(MYLIB/MYSAVF)``

#### Method 3: Installing via Relic Package Manager
Each directory in `/main/` is a seperate item, each are installable seperatly with Relic. The base command is `RELICGET PLOC('https://github.com/OSSILE/OSSILE/archive/master.zip') PDIR('OSSILE-master/main/<ITEM>') PNAME(OSSILE)`, where `<ITEM>` is one of those directories. For example:

* `PDIR('OSSILE-master/main/crtfrmstmf')`
* `PDIR('OSSILE-master/main/udtf_image_catalog_details')`

# OSSILE directory structure
These are the main directories within OSSILE:
## ``main/``
 This directory houses complete, buildable code. In other words, it contains all the tools and utilities we list above as "included in OSSILE".
 Each subdirectory represents a separate buildable item.
## ``code_examples/``
 This is where one can find examples of how to accomplish various tasks in ILE languages. They do not need to be working, compilable examples, though that is preferred.
 Inside this directory, there are subdirectories for the various ILE languages. The code examples are located in the appropriate lanuage directory.
## ``sql_examples/``
 This directory houses examples of how to accomplish various tasks using SQL scripts.
